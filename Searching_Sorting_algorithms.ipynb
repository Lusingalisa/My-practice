    "# QUICK SORT #\n",
    "- This is an algorithm based on the divide and conquer that picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot by placing the pivot in its correct position in the sorted array.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complexity analysis**\n",
    "- best case: Omega(n log n), this occurs when the pivot element divides the array into two equal halves.\n",
    "- worst case: O(n^2), This occurs when the smallest or largest element is always chosen as the pivot for example sorted arrays.\n",
    "- average case: Theta(n log n), thes happens when the pivot divides the array into two parts, but they are not necessarily equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of quick sort**\n",
    "- It is a divide-and-conquer algorithm, this makes it easier to solve problems.\n",
    "- It is efficient on large data sets.\n",
    "- It only requires a small amountof memory to function.\n",
    "- It is the fastest general purpose algorithm for large data when stability is not required.\n",
    "- It is tail recursive and hence all the tail call optimization can be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages of quick sort**\n",
    "- It is not a good choice for small datasets.\n",
    "- It is not a stable sorting algorithm.\n",
    "- It has a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2), which occurs when the pivot is chosen poorly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use it**\n",
    "- When sorting large datasets.\n",
    "- usedin partitioning problems like finding the kth smallest element or dividing arrays ny pivot.\n",
    "- When generating random permuatations and unpredictable encryption keys. \n",
    "\n",
    "**When to not use it**\n",
    "- When data is already or nearly sorted.\n",
    "- When stability is required.\n",
